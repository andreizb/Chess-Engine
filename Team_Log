[Rares | 26.02.2020-10:06] Created 'Team_Log'

[Andrei | 08.03.2020-16:00] Implemented xboard commands and basic
	representation of the chess board.

[Rares | 11.03.2020-13:00] Commented and greatly structured the code in use.
	Added namespaces and header files. Compilation files also changed (see
	Makefile)

[Rares | 11.03.2020-14:15] Fixed 'choose_function'. Now properly reads input
	and calls functions.

[Everyone | 15.03.2020-13:30] Refactored a big bulk of the project to use a
	more C++-ish approach, instead of C-ish 

[Rares | 12.03.2020-03:00] Implemented classes for every piece, each able to
	generate their possible moves (depth 1)

[Rares | 12.03.2020-15:30] Implemented side change, resign, opponent castle
	recognition and execution of every move by every piece (except own castling
	and promotion)

	recognition and execution of every move by every piece (except own castling

[Everyone | 17.04.2020-16:10] Converted whole project to java and tweaked small
	snippets of code

[Catalin | 17.04.2020-18:45] Implemented cloning methods for cloneable classes

[Andrei | 18.04.2020-01:46] Implemented easier and better move generation.

[Andrei | 18.04.2020-14:54] Implemented better move validation and application.

[Catalin | 18.04.2020-17:45] Implemented basic heuristics to use for future algorithms

[Catalin | 18.04.2020-18:30] Implemented minimax(negamax) with alpha-beta pruning

[Rares | 21.04.2020-15:45] Fixed enPassant rule not working properly and added logging system.

[Rares | 21.04.2020-17:15] Further fixed the enPassant rule and promotion logic.

[Rares | 21.04.2020-23:40] Tweaked alpha-beta algorithm, fixed very small bugs
	found while playing versus FairyMax and updated README.md for the last push.

[Andrei | 19.05.2020-15:00] Added Piece-Square Tables for every piece and every color.

[Rares & Catalin | 19.05.2020-22:20] Implemented support for piece-square table usage.
	Added more heuristics (pawn structure and status).
